ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

We're the Decentralized Cures DAO.  (DAO stands for decentralized autonomous organization.)  

Our mission is to end suffering caused by chronic diseases affecting billions of people. 

We're looking to collaborate with anyone on a global platform for anonymously 
collecting, aggregating, standardizing, analyzing, and sharing digital health data. 

ðŸ“« You can contact us at anonymous@decentralizedcures.org to join the DAO or learn more.
